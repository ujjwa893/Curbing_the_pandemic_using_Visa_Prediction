# Curbing_the_pandemic_using_Visa_Prediction
## Description

This was our project for the course : Data Analytics and Visualisation wherein we we aim to predict the outcome of H-1B visa applications that are filed by
many high-skilled foreign nationals every year. We considered as a classification problem and applied Gaussian Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree
Model,Random Forests and Artificial Neural Networks in order to output a predicted case status of the application. The input to our algorithm is the attributes of the applicant.

## Tech Stack used

Python : as the primary programming language
Jupyter Notebook : as the platform to run individual sections of the code
Various ML libraries in python : To visualise,preprocess and build models on the dataset.
